QUESTION ANSWER SYSTEM. Did you find an interesting article and want to easily find related research without browsing all existing publications yourself? DO you want to find important sentnces regarding your query in the papers? Do you have a specific research question and want to discover relevant articles? Then this work might help you. Our model can help you with all of your queries\n","\n","**Approach**:\n","We, as a multi-disciplinary research group (three program developers, a biologist, and a physician), conducted lots of surveys on the Coronavirus-related family on Kaggle provided articles. Our programmer members designed a dataset, as an efficient search engine, to find the most related answers to questions of the Kaggle’s competition. Our biologist and physician members use questions of the competition to evaluate and score our search engine. We use two approaches to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of our data set. First, we evaluated our result by searching according to the exact word and sentences of task questions, and compare its result by related keywords, which we found in related publications. Our analysis shows that by using lots of related keywords, we can access to the most relevant articles and relevant sentences.\n","Furthermore, our programmers used two algorithms to find related articles. Our first algorithms prepared based on finding an article according to the title of the paper, and the second approach was finding paper by searching the content of the article. According to our scoring system for these two methods, we convinced that the searching content of the articles would provide more related articles.\n","As a final survey, we compare our results by another data set on this competition to fix our possible errors. fortunately, we are happy to announce that our results were meaningfully much more accurate compare to similar search engines as a final survey we compare our result by another data set on this competition in order to fix our possible errors. \n","\n","**Quickstart possible**: You don't have to train the model yourself, you can simply load it from the output files!\n","\n","---\n","\n","___\n","\n","** Features**\n","* Similarity measure to show the **confidence** in the recommendations\n","* Plots that show the **topic-distribution** of an article\n","* Select a **time range** to limit the articles that are considered (you can decide if you want to find the latest publications or search for insights in past research)\n","* Option to only suggest **COVID-19-papers** (those that contain COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov, SARS Coronavirus 2 or 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the text body)\n","\n","**Following are the steps we followed to build the model based on the searching content of the articles would provide more related articles-**\n","\n","\n","**WORD2VEC-**\n","\n","* For each of the paper present, we used three column of the dataset- Title, Abstract and Body text and combined them to form a ‘complete text’  containing all the text present in each of the paper.\n","*Then we performed pre-processing on the ‘complete text’.  We used scispaCy,  a Python package containing spaCy models for processing biomedical, scientific or clinical text. We removed the stop words and perform word lemmatization on the text data. We also removed some common unnecessary words such as author, figure, copyrights, license, fig. Etc from the  ‘complete text’. \n","* We used ‘Gensim’ Python library to train our word2vec model on the  ‘complete text’ for each of the paper present in the dataset. We then save the word2vec model for the future uses.\n","\n","**LDA TOPIC MODELING and FINDING ANSWERS TO THE QUERY-**\n","\n","* We trained a LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model for topic modeling on the given dataset. In topic modeling each topic is a distribution over words and each document/paper is a mixture of topics  We discovered 50 as optimum number of topics.\n","*Each paper was assigned a set of topic that is, Each paper is a mixture of topics / a distribution. We have a LDA space, a simplex. The dimensionality of the space depends on the number of topics. .I.e. 50. Each paper is close to the most strong topics that represent it.  \n","* We then used Jensen-Shannon distance to measure the similarity between two probability distribution.\n","* Now, for the given query we used the Jensen-Shannon distance between the user query and the papers present in the topic space to find the top 50 relevant paper which is closest to the user query and might contain the answer to the query. As a similarity measure we use 1 - Jensen-Shannon distance. Higher the similarity score more close the paper is to the query.\n","* We then convert each paper into a set of sentences. We combine all the sentences in a list that is generated from the relevant papers.
